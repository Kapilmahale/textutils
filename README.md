## ⚙️ Technologies Used

| Tool           | Purpose                         |
|----------------|----------------------------------|
| **React.js**   | Frontend framework               |

This project helped me deepen my understanding of React.js, especially how to manage component state using useState. I learned how to create reusable components like a text form and navbar, handle real-time user input, and update the UI dynamically. I also practiced passing props between components and applying conditional rendering. This project enhanced my skills in building single-page applications and improved my confidence in structuring clean and functional frontend projects using React.
